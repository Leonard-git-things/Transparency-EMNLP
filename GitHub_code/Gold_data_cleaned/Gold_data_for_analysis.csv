About ad quality and user experience
Ad quality is the measurement of the experience our users have when they see the ads and reach the landing page.
We will collect feedback from people who make purchases across our platform and share this feedback to help you understand how your business meets customer expectations. Refer to your ACE page of TikTok Ads Manager (TTAM) for more details.
If any feedback, including a significant amount of negative feedback, indicates that you aren't complying with our ACE policies, the account may lose its ability to advertise. Learn more inBest practices for maintaining a healthy ACE account.
TikTok Shop Quality Score
To ensure a positive user experience, the quality score of your TikTok shop may impact your ability to run ads. Shops that consistently maintain low-quality scores may see limitations on their ad reach and frequency until improvements are made.
How It Works:
Higher quality scoreslead to broader ad distribution and increased visibility, rewarding shops that provide excellent service and customer satisfaction.
Shops with lower scoresmay experience restricted ad exposure until their performance improves to meet platform standards.
Advertisers facing ad limitations due to low-quality scores will receive a detailed notification explaining the issues, along with recommended steps for improvement. An appeal process is available through the advertiser portal to address any concerns.
How ad quality and user experience impacts your ad accounts
Better ad quality means better performance, higher positions, and lower costs.
If your ads go against our guidelines, or could harm us or users, we might take actions that impact your ad account, depending on the context and severity of the violation.
Your ad account behavior determines:
Eligibility: Ads must meet our quality standards to be displayed
Position in search results: Higher-quality ads are placed higher, based on your ad account's performance
Pay-per-click cost: Higher quality ads typically cost less per click
Ad performance: High-quality ads often lead to more clicks and conversions
There are different stages for each ACE policy violation. Once you receive a violation, you will have a 48 hours to amend any similar content to prevent additional violations. The original violation will still be applied to your account.
ACE policy violation levels
Complaints are typically submitted by an affected individual or organization. If you receive any complaints, we will take appropriate action based on the situation.
The processing timeline starts from the date a complaint is issued. We will review the supporting evidence and plans provided by both you and the complainant. Our decisions will be fair, based on feedback and details from our users and platform.

If you don't meet the deadline, we can cancel your ad plan, block new accounts, or freeze your account and deposit.

About ad quality and user experience
Ad quality is the measurement of the experience our users have when they see the ads and reach the landing page.
We will collect feedback from people who make purchases across our platform and share this feedback to help you understand how your business meets customer expectations. Refer to your ACE page of TikTok Ads Manager (TTAM) for more details.
If any feedback, including a significant amount of negative feedback, indicates that you aren't complying with our ACE policies, the account may lose its ability to advertise. Learn more inBest practices for maintaining a healthy ACE account.
TikTok Shop Quality Score
To ensure a positive user experience, the quality score of your TikTok shop may impact your ability to run ads. Shops that consistently maintain low-quality scores may see limitations on their ad reach and frequency until improvements are made.
How It Works:
Higher quality scoreslead to broader ad distribution and increased visibility, rewarding shops that provide excellent service and customer satisfaction.
Shops with lower scoresmay experience restricted ad exposure until their performance improves to meet platform standards.
Advertisers facing ad limitations due to low-quality scores will receive a detailed notification explaining the issues, along with recommended steps for improvement. An appeal process is available through the advertiser portal to address any concerns.
How ad quality and user experience impacts your ad accounts
Better ad quality means better performance, higher positions, and lower costs.
If your ads go against our guidelines, or could harm us or users, we might take actions that impact your ad account, depending on the context and severity of the violation.
Your ad account behavior determines:
Eligibility: Ads must meet our quality standards to be displayed
Position in search results: Higher-quality ads are placed higher, based on your ad account's performance
Pay-per-click cost: Higher quality ads typically cost less per click
Ad performance: High-quality ads often lead to more clicks and conversions
There are different stages for each ACE policy violation. Once you receive a violation, you will have a 48 hours to amend any similar content to prevent additional violations. The original violation will still be applied to your account.
ACE policy violation levels
Complaints are typically submitted by an affected individual or organization. If you receive any complaints, we will take appropriate action based on the situation.
The processing timeline starts from the date a complaint is issued. We will review the supporting evidence and plans provided by both you and the complainant. Our decisions will be fair, based on feedback and details from our users and platform.
Following the deadline doesn't release you from other legal responsibilties and agreements.
If you don't meet the deadline, we can cancel your ad plan, block new accounts, or freeze your account and deposit.
Complaint types and handling
If you believe your account was restricted or suspended in error, submit anAppeal Request, seeAppeal rejected ad with One Click Appeal for Other Ad Typesfor details.
To keep your account healthy, follow these recommendations to manage customer expectations:
Clearly present your products
Ensure that your pictures, videos, and all ad content accurately represent what you're offering
Match dimensions, sizes, materials, and other product details with what's stated in the ad
If you source goods from suppliers, maintain quality control and ship on time as promised
Set transparent shipping expectations
Provide door-to-door shipping times, consider processing times, item availability, and shipping costs
Whenever possible, provide tracking information for customers to monitor their packages
Provide essential customer service
Clearly state return policies as advertised on your website
If you're in a different time zone, specify response times to customer inquiries
Limit the frequency of in-app ads
Avoid overwhelming users with excessive in-app advertisements.
A high volume of ads can lead to frustration, app abandonment, and a negative perception of your brand.
Maintain a balanced ad experience that complements, rather than disrupts, user engagement.
Be transparent about costs and features
Clearly communicate any potential expenses related to app features or services upfront.
Unexpected charges, hidden fees, or paywalls for essential features can erode trust and lead to negative reviews.
Ensure ad content accurately reflects the product or service experience
Align your ad content messaging with the actual features, functionality, or services offered by your product or service.
Misleading ads that depict unrealistic capabilities or services can lead to user disappointment and decreased customer retention.
Set realistic expectations for products and services
When promoting products or services, avoid implying guaranteed outcomes or unrealistic delivery timelines.
Clearly outline eligibility requirements, processes, and potential limitations to prevent misunderstandings and maintain customer trust.

About ad quality and user experience
Ad quality is the measurement of the experience our users have when they see the ads and reach the landing page.
We will collect feedback from people who make purchases across our platform and share this feedback to help you understand how your business meets customer expectations. Refer to your ACE page of TikTok Ads Manager (TTAM) for more details.
If any feedback, including a significant amount of negative feedback, indicates that you aren't complying with our ACE policies, the account may lose its ability to advertise. Learn more inBest practices for maintaining a healthy ACE account.
TikTok Shop Quality Score
To ensure a positive user experience, the quality score of your TikTok shop may impact your ability to run ads. Shops that consistently maintain low-quality scores may see limitations on their ad reach and frequency until improvements are made.
How It Works:
Higher quality scoreslead to broader ad distribution and increased visibility, rewarding shops that provide excellent service and customer satisfaction.
Shops with lower scoresmay experience restricted ad exposure until their performance improves to meet platform standards.
Advertisers facing ad limitations due to low-quality scores will receive a detailed notification explaining the issues, along with recommended steps for improvement. An appeal process is available through the advertiser portal to address any concerns.
How ad quality and user experience impacts your ad accounts
Better ad quality means better performance, higher positions, and lower costs.
If your ads go against our guidelines, or could harm us or users, we might take actions that impact your ad account, depending on the context and severity of the violation.
Your ad account behavior determines:
Eligibility: Ads must meet our quality standards to be displayed
Position in search results: Higher-quality ads are placed higher, based on your ad account's performance
Pay-per-click cost: Higher quality ads typically cost less per click
Ad performance: High-quality ads often lead to more clicks and conversions
There are different stages for each ACE policy violation. Once you receive a violation, you will have a 48 hours to amend any similar content to prevent additional violations. The original violation will still be applied to your account.
ACE policy violation levels
Complaints are typically submitted by an affected individual or organization. If you receive any complaints, we will take appropriate action based on the situation.
The processing timeline starts from the date a complaint is issued. We will review the supporting evidence and plans provided by both you and the complainant. Our decisions will be fair, based on feedback and details from our users and platform.
Following the deadline doesn't release you from other legal responsibilties and agreements.
If you don't meet the deadline, we can cancel your ad plan, block new accounts, or freeze your account and deposit.
Complaint types and handling
If you believe your account was restricted or suspended in error, submit anAppeal Request, seeAppeal rejected ad with One Click Appeal for Other Ad Typesfor details.
To keep your account healthy, follow these recommendations to manage customer expectations:
Clearly present your products
Ensure that your pictures, videos, and all ad content accurately represent what you're offering
Match dimensions, sizes, materials, and other product details with what's stated in the ad
If you source goods from suppliers, maintain quality control and ship on time as promised
Set transparent shipping expectations
Provide door-to-door shipping times, consider processing times, item availability, and shipping costs
Whenever possible, provide tracking information for customers to monitor their packages
Provide essential customer service
Clearly state return policies as advertised on your website
If you're in a different time zone, specify response times to customer inquiries
Limit the frequency of in-app ads
Avoid overwhelming users with excessive in-app advertisements.
A high volume of ads can lead to frustration, app abandonment, and a negative perception of your brand.
Maintain a balanced ad experience that complements, rather than disrupts, user engagement.
Be transparent about costs and features
Clearly communicate any potential expenses related to app features or services upfront.
Unexpected charges, hidden fees, or paywalls for essential features can erode trust and lead to negative reviews.
Ensure ad content accurately reflects the product or service experience
Align your ad content messaging with the actual features, functionality, or services offered by your product or service.
Misleading ads that depict unrealistic capabilities or services can lead to user disappointment and decreased customer retention.
Set realistic expectations for products and services
When promoting products or services, avoid implying guaranteed outcomes or unrealistic delivery timelines.
Clearly outline eligibility requirements, processes, and potential limitations to prevent misunderstandings and maintain customer trust.

This guideline applies to all advertisers registered on our platform and agree to theTikTok For Business Commercial Terms of ServiceandTikTok Partner Privacy Policy.

Reviews of goods and services
We hold the right to conduct an ACE Evaluation for your performances.
Actively communicate with users during the contract fulfillment process to resolve user demands and avoid causing negative user experience
Do not engage in any illegal, criminal and unethical activities, such as fraud, gambling, prostitution, pyramid schemes, illegal medical practice
Do not illegally collect and dispose users’ personal information, such as reselling customer info
Do not provide goods or services that violate the requirements of laws and regulations, nor may infringe on the personal and property safety of users, such as providing counterfeit and shoddy products
Do not attempt to impersonate or misuse other brands through the use of the same trademark, this includes using TikTok Shop overlay without prior authorization
Do not falsely promote or defraud users, such as products or services, prices, gifts, after-sales services that are inconsistent with advertising content, advertiser commitments, and contract agreements

About ad quality and user experience
Ad quality is the measurement of the experience our users have when they see the ads and reach the landing page.
We will collect feedback from people who make purchases across our platform and share this feedback to help you understand how your business meets customer expectations. Refer to your ACE page of TikTok Ads Manager (TTAM) for more details.
If any feedback, including a significant amount of negative feedback, indicates that you aren't complying with our ACE policies, the account may lose its ability to advertise. Learn more inBest practices for maintaining a healthy ACE account.
TikTok Shop Quality Score
To ensure a positive user experience, the quality score of your TikTok shop may impact your ability to run ads. Shops that consistently maintain low-quality scores may see limitations on their ad reach and frequency until improvements are made.
How It Works:
Higher quality scoreslead to broader ad distribution and increased visibility, rewarding shops that provide excellent service and customer satisfaction.
Shops with lower scoresmay experience restricted ad exposure until their performance improves to meet platform standards.
Advertisers facing ad limitations due to low-quality scores will receive a detailed notification explaining the issues, along with recommended steps for improvement. An appeal process is available through the advertiser portal to address any concerns.
How ad quality and user experience impacts your ad accounts
Better ad quality means better performance, higher positions, and lower costs.
If your ads go against our guidelines, or could harm us or users, we might take actions that impact your ad account, depending on the context and severity of the violation.
Your ad account behavior determines:
Eligibility: Ads must meet our quality standards to be displayed
Position in search results: Higher-quality ads are placed higher, based on your ad account's performance
Pay-per-click cost: Higher quality ads typically cost less per click
Ad performance: High-quality ads often lead to more clicks and conversions
There are different stages for each ACE policy violation. Once you receive a violation, you will have a 48 hours to amend any similar content to prevent additional violations. The original violation will still be applied to your account.
ACE policy violation levels
Complaints are typically submitted by an affected individual or organization. If you receive any complaints, we will take appropriate action based on the situation.
The processing timeline starts from the date a complaint is issued. We will review the supporting evidence and plans provided by both you and the complainant. Our decisions will be fair, based on feedback and details from our users and platform.
Following the deadline doesn't release you from other legal responsibilties and agreements.
If you don't meet the deadline, we can cancel your ad plan, block new accounts, or freeze your account and deposit.
Complaint types and handling
If you believe your account was restricted or suspended in error, submit anAppeal Request, seeAppeal rejected ad with One Click Appeal for Other Ad Typesfor details.
To keep your account healthy, follow these recommendations to manage customer expectations:
Clearly present your products
Ensure that your pictures, videos, and all ad content accurately represent what you're offering
Match dimensions, sizes, materials, and other product details with what's stated in the ad
If you source goods from suppliers, maintain quality control and ship on time as promised
Set transparent shipping expectations
Provide door-to-door shipping times, consider processing times, item availability, and shipping costs
Whenever possible, provide tracking information for customers to monitor their packages
Provide essential customer service
Clearly state return policies as advertised on your website
If you're in a different time zone, specify response times to customer inquiries
Limit the frequency of in-app ads
Avoid overwhelming users with excessive in-app advertisements.
A high volume of ads can lead to frustration, app abandonment, and a negative perception of your brand.
Maintain a balanced ad experience that complements, rather than disrupts, user engagement.
Be transparent about costs and features
Clearly communicate any potential expenses related to app features or services upfront.
Unexpected charges, hidden fees, or paywalls for essential features can erode trust and lead to negative reviews.
Ensure ad content accurately reflects the product or service experience
Align your ad content messaging with the actual features, functionality, or services offered by your product or service.
Misleading ads that depict unrealistic capabilities or services can lead to user disappointment and decreased customer retention.
Set realistic expectations for products and services
When promoting products or services, avoid implying guaranteed outcomes or unrealistic delivery timelines.
Clearly outline eligibility requirements, processes, and potential limitations to prevent misunderstandings and maintain customer trust.

This means complying with all applicable laws, rules and regulations (including any advertising codes) that apply to the targeted regions. In some jurisdictions, such as Nigeria, advertisements must be approved prior to publication by the regulatory authority or submitted to the regulatory authority for notification or registration within a certain time period after publication. We may list out the local advertising regulatory requirements that we are aware of for your reference, in addition to the TikTok Advertising Policies that apply to all of TikTok's paid advertising products. You may want to consult with your legal consultant to obtain the most updated local regulation requirements.
The Advertising Regulatory Council of Nigeria Act 2022 (the ""ARCON Act"") imposes a general obligation on advertisers and agencies to obtain prior approval of the Advertising Standards Panel (""ASP"") before publishing any advertisement targeting the Nigerian market. No matter if the advertiser or agency resides in Nigeria or not, before publishing any ad campaign targeting Nigeria, the advertiser or agency has the legal obligation to apply for and obtain a Certificate of Approval granted by ASP, signed by the Director General of the Advertising Regulatory Council, certifying approval of all advertising content (including words and numbers (spoken or written), visual representations, music and sound effects) to be published via ad placement on TikTOk platforms. According to the ARCON Act, the penalty for failing to comply with this pre-approval requirement will be administrative fines. Individuals and entities who breach this requirement may also be liable to any person who has suffered loss as a result of the breach, and such person has the right to commence legal proceedings against the individuals and entities for compensation.

This guideline applies to all advertisers registered on our platform and agree to theTikTok For Business Commercial Terms of ServiceandTikTok Partner Privacy Policy.

Reports
Comments
Reviews of goods and services
We hold the right to conduct an ACE Evaluation for your performances.
Actively communicate with users during the contract fulfillment process to resolve user demands and avoid causing negative user experience
Do not engage in any illegal, criminal and unethical activities, such as fraud, gambling, prostitution, pyramid schemes, illegal medical practice
Do not illegally collect and dispose users’ personal information, such as reselling customer info
Do not provide goods or services that violate the requirements of laws and regulations, nor may infringe on the personal and property safety of users, such as providing counterfeit and shoddy products
Do not attempt to impersonate or misuse other brands through the use of the same trademark, this includes using TikTok Shop overlay without prior authorization

About ad quality and user experience
Ad quality is the measurement of the experience our users have when they see the ads and reach the landing page.
We will collect feedback from people who make purchases across our platform and share this feedback to help you understand how your business meets customer expectations. Refer to your ACE page of TikTok Ads Manager (TTAM) for more details.
If any feedback, including a significant amount of negative feedback, indicates that you aren't complying with our ACE policies, the account may lose its ability to advertise. Learn more inBest practices for maintaining a healthy ACE account.
TikTok Shop Quality Score
To ensure a positive user experience, the quality score of your TikTok shop may impact your ability to run ads. Shops that consistently maintain low-quality scores may see limitations on their ad reach and frequency until improvements are made.
How It Works:
Higher quality scoreslead to broader ad distribution and increased visibility, rewarding shops that provide excellent service and customer satisfaction.
Shops with lower scoresmay experience restricted ad exposure until their performance improves to meet platform standards.
Advertisers facing ad limitations due to low-quality scores will receive a detailed notification explaining the issues, along with recommended steps for improvement. An appeal process is available through the advertiser portal to address any concerns.
How ad quality and user experience impacts your ad accounts
Better ad quality means better performance, higher positions, and lower costs.
If your ads go against our guidelines, or could harm us or users, we might take actions that impact your ad account, depending on the context and severity of the violation.
Your ad account behavior determines:
Eligibility: Ads must meet our quality standards to be displayed
Position in search results: Higher-quality ads are placed higher, based on your ad account's performance
Pay-per-click cost: Higher quality ads typically cost less per click
Ad performance: High-quality ads often lead to more clicks and conversions
There are different stages for each ACE policy violation. Once you receive a violation, you will have a 48 hours to amend any similar content to prevent additional violations. The original violation will still be applied to your account.
ACE policy violation levels
Complaints are typically submitted by an affected individual or organization. If you receive any complaints, we will take appropriate action based on the situation.
The processing timeline starts from the date a complaint is issued. We will review the supporting evidence and plans provided by both you and the complainant. Our decisions will be fair, based on feedback and details from our users and platform.
Following the deadline doesn't release you from other legal responsibilties and agreements.
If you don't meet the deadline, we can cancel your ad plan, block new accounts, or freeze your account and deposit.
Complaint types and handling
If you believe your account was restricted or suspended in error, submit anAppeal Request, seeAppeal rejected ad with One Click Appeal for Other Ad Typesfor details.
To keep your account healthy, follow these recommendations to manage customer expectations:
Clearly present your products
Ensure that your pictures, videos, and all ad content accurately represent what you're offering
Match dimensions, sizes, materials, and other product details with what's stated in the ad
If you source goods from suppliers, maintain quality control and ship on time as promised
Set transparent shipping expectations
Provide door-to-door shipping times, consider processing times, item availability, and shipping costs
Whenever possible, provide tracking information for customers to monitor their packages
Provide essential customer service
Clearly state return policies as advertised on your website
If you're in a different time zone, specify response times to customer inquiries
Limit the frequency of in-app ads
Avoid overwhelming users with excessive in-app advertisements.
A high volume of ads can lead to frustration, app abandonment, and a negative perception of your brand.
Maintain a balanced ad experience that complements, rather than disrupts, user engagement.
Be transparent about costs and features
Clearly communicate any potential expenses related to app features or services upfront.
Unexpected charges, hidden fees, or paywalls for essential features can erode trust and lead to negative reviews.
Ensure ad content accurately reflects the product or service experience
Align your ad content messaging with the actual features, functionality, or services offered by your product or service.
Misleading ads that depict unrealistic capabilities or services can lead to user disappointment and decreased customer retention.
Set realistic expectations for products and services
When promoting products or services, avoid implying guaranteed outcomes or unrealistic delivery timelines.
Clearly outline eligibility requirements, processes, and potential limitations to prevent misunderstandings and maintain customer trust.

At TikTok, we aim to maximize value for customers and businesses. We're dedicated to enhancing the After Conversion Experience (ACE) for our users.
This guideline applies to all advertisers registered on our platform and agree to theTikTok For Business Commercial Terms of ServiceandTikTok Partner Privacy Policy.
ACE evaluation
Our platform's negative feedback on advertising content, goods or services, transactions, after-sales services, and conversion behaviors during the process of purchasing goods or services after users browse and click on ads may include:
User complaints
Reports
Comments
Reviews of goods and services
We hold the right to conduct an ACE Evaluation for your performances.
Actively communicate with users during the contract fulfillment process to resolve user demands and avoid causing negative user experience
Do not engage in any illegal, criminal and unethical activities, such as fraud, gambling, prostitution, pyramid schemes, illegal medical practice
Do not illegally collect and dispose users’ personal information, such as reselling customer info
Do not provide goods or services that violate the requirements of laws and regulations, nor may infringe on the personal and property safety of users, such as providing counterfeit and shoddy products
Do not attempt to impersonate or misuse other brands through the use of the same trademark, this includes using TikTok Shop overlay without prior authorization
Do not falsely promote or defraud users, such as products or services, prices, gifts, after-sales services that are inconsistent with advertising content, advertiser commitments, and contract agreements
Do not induce users to pay or purchase goods or services against their true wishes, such as malicious deductions, unauthorized increases, hidden charges

About ad quality and user experience
Ad quality is the measurement of the experience our users have when they see the ads and reach the landing page.
We will collect feedback from people who make purchases across our platform and share this feedback to help you understand how your business meets customer expectations. Refer to your ACE page of TikTok Ads Manager (TTAM) for more details.
If any feedback, including a significant amount of negative feedback, indicates that you aren't complying with our ACE policies, the account may lose its ability to advertise. Learn more inBest practices for maintaining a healthy ACE account.
TikTok Shop Quality Score
To ensure a positive user experience, the quality score of your TikTok shop may impact your ability to run ads. Shops that consistently maintain low-quality scores may see limitations on their ad reach and frequency until improvements are made.
How It Works:
Higher quality scoreslead to broader ad distribution and increased visibility, rewarding shops that provide excellent service and customer satisfaction.
Shops with lower scoresmay experience restricted ad exposure until their performance improves to meet platform standards.
Advertisers facing ad limitations due to low-quality scores will receive a detailed notification explaining the issues, along with recommended steps for improvement. An appeal process is available through the advertiser portal to address any concerns.
How ad quality and user experience impacts your ad accounts
Better ad quality means better performance, higher positions, and lower costs.
If your ads go against our guidelines, or could harm us or users, we might take actions that impact your ad account, depending on the context and severity of the violation.
Your ad account behavior determines:
Eligibility: Ads must meet our quality standards to be displayed
Position in search results: Higher-quality ads are placed higher, based on your ad account's performance
Pay-per-click cost: Higher quality ads typically cost less per click
Ad performance: High-quality ads often lead to more clicks and conversions
There are different stages for each ACE policy violation. Once you receive a violation, you will have a 48 hours to amend any similar content to prevent additional violations. The original violation will still be applied to your account.
ACE policy violation levels
Complaints are typically submitted by an affected individual or organization. If you receive any complaints, we will take appropriate action based on the situation.
The processing timeline starts from the date a complaint is issued. We will review the supporting evidence and plans provided by both you and the complainant. Our decisions will be fair, based on feedback and details from our users and platform.
Following the deadline doesn't release you from other legal responsibilties and agreements.
If you don't meet the deadline, we can cancel your ad plan, block new accounts, or freeze your account and deposit.
Complaint types and handling
If you believe your account was restricted or suspended in error, submit anAppeal Request, seeAppeal rejected ad with One Click Appeal for Other Ad Typesfor details.
To keep your account healthy, follow these recommendations to manage customer expectations:
Clearly present your products
Ensure that your pictures, videos, and all ad content accurately represent what you're offering
Match dimensions, sizes, materials, and other product details with what's stated in the ad
If you source goods from suppliers, maintain quality control and ship on time as promised
Set transparent shipping expectations
Provide door-to-door shipping times, consider processing times, item availability, and shipping costs
Whenever possible, provide tracking information for customers to monitor their packages
Provide essential customer service
Clearly state return policies as advertised on your website
If you're in a different time zone, specify response times to customer inquiries
Limit the frequency of in-app ads
Avoid overwhelming users with excessive in-app advertisements.
A high volume of ads can lead to frustration, app abandonment, and a negative perception of your brand.
Maintain a balanced ad experience that complements, rather than disrupts, user engagement.
Be transparent about costs and features
Clearly communicate any potential expenses related to app features or services upfront.
Unexpected charges, hidden fees, or paywalls for essential features can erode trust and lead to negative reviews.
Ensure ad content accurately reflects the product or service experience
Align your ad content messaging with the actual features, functionality, or services offered by your product or service.
Misleading ads that depict unrealistic capabilities or services can lead to user disappointment and decreased customer retention.
Set realistic expectations for products and services
When promoting products or services, avoid implying guaranteed outcomes or unrealistic delivery timelines.
Clearly outline eligibility requirements, processes, and potential limitations to prevent misunderstandings and maintain customer trust.
