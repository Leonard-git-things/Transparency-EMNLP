2;Market Specific Requirements for Ad Approval;"As an advertiser on TikTok, you are responsible for your ads. This means complying with all applicable laws, rules and regulations (including any advertising codes) that apply to the targeted regions. In some jurisdictions, such as Nigeria, advertisements must be approved prior to publication by the regulatory authority or submitted to the regulatory authority for notification or registration within a certain time period after publication. We may list out the local advertising regulatory requirements that we are aware of for your reference, in addition to the TikTok Advertising Policies that apply to all of TikTok's paid advertising products. You may want to consult with your legal consultant to obtain the most updated local regulation requirements.
The Advertising Regulatory Council of Nigeria Act 2022 (the ""ARCON Act"") imposes a general obligation on advertisers and agencies to obtain prior approval of the Advertising Standards Panel (""ASP"") before publishing any advertisement targeting the Nigerian market. No matter if the advertiser or agency resides in Nigeria or not, before publishing any ad campaign targeting Nigeria, the advertiser or agency has the legal obligation to apply for and obtain a Certificate of Approval granted by ASP, signed by the Director General of the Advertising Regulatory Council, certifying approval of all advertising content (including words and numbers (spoken or written), visual representations, music and sound effects) to be published via ad placement on TikTOk platforms. According to the ARCON Act, the penalty for failing to comply with this pre-approval requirement will be administrative fines. Individuals and entities who breach this requirement may also be liable to any person who has suffered loss as a result of the breach, and such person has the right to commence legal proceedings against the individuals and entities for compensation.

About ad quality and user experience
Ad quality is the measurement of the experience our users have when they see the ads and reach the landing page.
We will collect feedback from people who make purchases across our platform and share this feedback to help you understand how your business meets customer expectations. Refer to your ACE page of TikTok Ads Manager (TTAM) for more details.
If any feedback, including a significant amount of negative feedback, indicates that you aren't complying with our ACE policies, the account may lose its ability to advertise. Learn more inBest practices for maintaining a healthy ACE account.
TikTok Shop Quality Score
To ensure a positive user experience, the quality score of your TikTok shop may impact your ability to run ads. Shops that consistently maintain low-quality scores may see limitations on their ad reach and frequency until improvements are made.
How It Works:
Higher quality scoreslead to broader ad distribution and increased visibility, rewarding shops that provide excellent service and customer satisfaction.
Shops with lower scoresmay experience restricted ad exposure until their performance improves to meet platform standards.
Advertisers facing ad limitations due to low-quality scores will receive a detailed notification explaining the issues, along with recommended steps for improvement. An appeal process is available through the advertiser portal to address any concerns.
How ad quality and user experience impacts your ad accounts
Better ad quality means better performance, higher positions, and lower costs.
If your ads go against our guidelines, or could harm us or users, we might take actions that impact your ad account, depending on the context and severity of the violation.
Your ad account behavior determines:
Eligibility: Ads must meet our quality standards to be displayed
Position in search results: Higher-quality ads are placed higher, based on your ad account's performance
Pay-per-click cost: Higher quality ads typically cost less per click
Ad performance: High-quality ads often lead to more clicks and conversions
There are different stages for each ACE policy violation. Once you receive a violation, you will have a 48 hours to amend any similar content to prevent additional violations. The original violation will still be applied to your account.
ACE policy violation levels
Complaints are typically submitted by an affected individual or organization. If you receive any complaints, we will take appropriate action based on the situation.
The processing timeline starts from the date a complaint is issued. We will review the supporting evidence and plans provided by both you and the complainant. Our decisions will be fair, based on feedback and details from our users and platform.
Following the deadline doesn't release you from other legal responsibilties and agreements.
If you don't meet the deadline, we can cancel your ad plan, block new accounts, or freeze your account and deposit.
Complaint types and handling
If you believe your account was restricted or suspended in error, submit anAppeal Request, seeAppeal rejected ad with One Click Appeal for Other Ad Typesfor details.

Whenever possible, provide tracking information for customers to monitor their packages
Provide essential customer service

Unexpected charges, hidden fees, or paywalls for essential features can erode trust and lead to negative reviews.

Misleading ads that depict unrealistic capabilities or services can lead to user disappointment and decreased customer retention.

56;Content Moderation;" ""To help ensure a safe, trustworthy, and vibrant experience, we maintain a set of Community Guidelines that include rules and standards for using TikTok. The guidelines apply to everyone and everything on our platform. They are informed by international legal frameworks, industry best practices, and input from our community, safety and public health experts, and our regional Advisory Councils.""";Guidelines Scope;Community Guidelines
57;Moderation Pillars;Our approach to content moderation is built on four pillars: 1. Remove violative content from the platform that breaks our rules 2. Age-restrict mature content so it is only viewed by adults (18 years and older) 3. Maintain For You feed (FYF) eligibility standards to help ensure any content that may be promoted by our recommendation system is appropriate for a broad audience 4. Empower our community with information, tools, and resources.;Content Moderation Strategy;Community Guidelines
58;Core Value;" ""If you are ever in doubt about what to share, keep in mind this core value — 'be kind and treat others the way that you would want to be treated.' Thanks for helping to keep TikTok a welcoming space for everyone!""";Core Principle;Community Guidelines
59;Safety Approach;Keeping our community both safe and vibrant requires finding the right balance between enabling expression and preventing harm. We do this through a mix of safety approaches, from developing rules and standards that we enforce, to building platform norms and resources that give our community members more agency and choice.;Safety and Expression;Community Guidelines
60;Violative Content Removal;Remove violative content. Everyone joins TikTok with the ability to freely share content on our platform. However, we have rules regarding harmful content that we do not allow. We seek to remove any content, whether publicly posted or private, that violates our rules. Although we work hard to enforce our rules, we cannot guarantee that all content shared on TikTok complies with our Terms of Service or Community Guidelines.;Content Removal;Community Guidelines
61;Age-Restriction;Age-restrict mature content. The breadth of content that is shared on TikTok is vast, which adds to the rich diversity of the experience. However, not all of it may be suitable for younger audiences. We limit overtly mature content so it is only viewed by adults 18 years and older.;Age Restriction Policy;Community Guidelines
62;For You Feed Standards;Maintain For You feed (FYF) eligibility standards. The FYF offers an opportunity for viewers to discover new content and for creators to reach new audiences. But promotion by our recommendation system is not guaranteed. Content that is not appropriate for a broad audience will be ineligible for the FYF.;FYF Standards;Community Guidelines
63;Community Empowerment;Empower our community. We want to make sure you have the right information to help you manage your experience on TikTok. For certain content, we add labels, 'opt-in' screens, or warnings to provide more context or notice.;Community Tools;Community Guidelines

111;Arbitration and Class Waiver;"14.2 **Arbitration Agreement; Class Waiver – if you are based in the United States**

PLEASE REVIEW THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS YOU AND TIKTOK MUTUALLY AGREE TO WAIVE OUR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES IN A COURT OF LAW BY A JUDGE OR JURY, AND AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE AGAINST EACH OTHER ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS IN ARBITRATION, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION (“**ARBITRATION AGREEMENT”**).

(a) Informal Resolution Process First 

If we have a dispute with you relating to or arising out of these Commercial Terms, we will first try and resolve it with you amicably. You agree to do the same for us.

The party raising a dispute will initiate this process by notifying the other in accordance with Section 15.9 of these Commercial Terms. The party receiving the notice will have 60 days to respond. If the dispute has not been resolved after the response time has expired, or within 30 days after a response has been issued, whichever is earlier, either party may initiate arbitration proceedings (or, to the extent permitted under this Arbitration Agreement, file court action) against the other. Engaging in this informal dispute resolution process is a requirement that must be completed before filing any legal action. You and TikTok agree that you both will make a good faith effort to resolve the dispute amicably before either you or TikTok files any legal action against the other, and that applicable statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process.

(b) Arbitration and Class Action Waiver

(i) Scope of Arbitration Agreement

The parties agree and acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“**FAA**”) will govern its interpretation and enforcement. 

The parties agree that after completing the informal dispute resolution process in Section 14.2(a), any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim relating to or arising out of your access to or use of the Commercial Products under these Commercial Terms, or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity of the Commercial Terms (“**Claims**”) will be resolved by binding individual arbitration, rather than by a court of law, except as otherwise provided below. If the parties’ dispute involves some arbitrable claims and some non-arbitrable claims, all non-arbitrable claims must be stayed until completion of the arbitration. This Arbitration Agreement shall apply to all Claims, including those that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Arbitration Agreement. By agreeing to this Arbitration Agreement, you and TikTok expressly agree not to initiate or participate in any existing or future class, collective or representative actions against the other, as set forth in Section 14.2(b)(vi).

Notwithstanding any other provision in these Commercial Terms, this Arbitration Agreement will not require arbitration of the following types of claims: (a) small claims actions brought on an individual basis that are within the scope of such small claims court’s jurisdiction, (b) injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s confidentiality rights or copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights, and (c) claims not subject to arbitration as a matter of generally applicable law, after accounting for FAA preemption. Additionally, to the extent a Claim seeks public injunctive relief that is found to be a cognizable claim, such Claim must be resolved by a court or law, and stayed pending the resolution of the arbitration of any related Claims.

To the extent the parties are permitted under this Arbitration Agreement to have a matter or Claim resolved by a court of law rather than in arbitration, you and TikTok agree that such matters or Claims shall be litigated exclusively in either the United States District Court for the Central District of California or the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such disputes.

(ii) Arbitration Rules and Forum

The arbitration will be conducted by National Arbitration & Mediation (“**NAM**”) under its Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (and, if applicable, Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, as discussed below) and the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, a party must satisfy the requirements pursuant to NAM’s rules. The most current version of the NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and the NAM Mass Filing Supplement Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures are available at [](https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/)[https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/](https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/). If NAM is unable to arbitrate the dispute for whatever reason, a court of competent jurisdiction shall appoint the arbitrator.

The payment of all filing, administration, and arbitration fees will be governed by the NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (and, if applicable, Mass Filing Supplement Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures), except that (1) the prevailing party may seek attorneys’ fees, costs, and reimbursement of NAM filing and professional service fees if the arbitrator finds that the opposing party brought a claim, counterclaim, or defense that was either frivolous or brought with an improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of arbitration; and (2) if a party timely serves an offer of judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 (or its state law equivalent), and the judgment that the other party finally obtains is not more favorable than the unaccepted offer, then the other party shall pay the costs, including filing fees, incurred after the offer was made.

(iii) Mass Filing and Bellwether Protocols

To increase efficiency of resolution, and subject to a decision by NAM to invoke its Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, the following protocol will apply if 100 or more similar arbitration demands are presented under these terms by or with the assistance of the same law firm or collection of law firms (“**Mass Filing**”). For the avoidance of doubt, NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures shall apply if the parties’ dispute is deemed by NAM, in its sole discretion pursuant to the NAM Rules and this Mutual Arbitration Provision, to be part of a Mass Filing.

Any Mass Filing shall be subject to bellwether protocols intended to reach a fair and speedy resolution of all claims included in the Mass Filing. In any Mass Filing, NAM shall randomly select four (4) demands for arbitration to proceed, and then claimants and respondents shall each select three (3) additional demands for arbitration to proceed -- for a total of ten (10) arbitrations (“**Bellwether Arbitrations**”). While the Bellwether Arbitrations are adjudicated, all other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing shall be held in abeyance and stayed, and no party shall be responsible for paying any administrator or arbitrator fees (other than NAM’s initial filing/administrative fees, and Procedural Arbitrator fees, if applicable) while the Bellwether Arbitrations are adjudicated. Any applicable statute of limitations regarding those demands shall remain tolled beginning when the Mass Filing claimant first provided the other party with notice of its intent to initiate informal dispute resolution, as discussed above.

The parties shall work in good faith with the arbitrator to complete each Bellwether Arbitration within 120 days of its initial pre-hearing conference.

The parties agree that these bellwether proceeding protocols are designed to achieve an overall faster, more efficient, and less costly mechanism for resolving Mass Filings, including claims that are not selected for Bellwether Arbitration.

Following the resolution of all of the Bellwether Arbitrations, the parties shall engage in a global mediation of all remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing. The mediation shall be administered by NAM. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing within 30 days following the mediation, the remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing shall be administered by NAM pursuant to the provisions below regarding batching, along with NAM Rules and NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures.

If the parties are unavailable to achieve global resolution following the above Bellwether Arbitrations and global mediation, these batching provisions shall apply and NAM shall (i) consolidate the arbitration demands into batches of no more than 100 demands per batch; and (ii) provide for resolution of each batch as a single arbitration proceeding with one arbitrator assigned per batch. This batching process shall not impact the nature of these actions as individual in nature, including that the arbitrator will make a separate determination for each claimant, nor shall it change the burden of proof on each individual claimant. You and TikTok both agree to cooperate in good faith with each other and the arbitration provider to implement such a batch approach, including in working with NAM to request a different fee schedule from that set forth in NAM’s relevant rules and that is more favorable to You and TikTok. Any disagreement over the batch approach will be determined with all affected parties in a single, consolidated arbitration proceeding with one arbitrator subject to the requirements of this Section and NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures.

(iv) Arbitrator Powers

The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the scope, interpretation or enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, except that a court of law has the exclusive authority to determine the enforceability of any part of the Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions provision in Section 14.2(b)(vi) of this Arbitration Agreement. All disputes regarding allocation of the arbitrator’s fees and / or the arbitration fees shall be determined exclusively by an arbitrator. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator will issue a written statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The award shall be binding only among the parties and shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or other proceeding involving a different party. The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on you and TikTok.

(v) Waiver of Jury Trial

You and TikTok waive any rights to sue in court and receive a judge or jury trial, except as otherwise specified in this Arbitration Agreement.

(vi) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions

You and TikTok agree to waive any right to have Claims decided on a class, collective or representative basis, except as set forth in this Section 14.2(b)(vi) (“**Class Action Waiver**”). In any case in which (1) Claims are filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (2) a civil court of competent jurisdiction finds all or part of the Class Action Waiver unenforceable, the class, collective, and/or representative action must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. This provision does not prevent you or TikTok from participating in a settlement on a class-wide, collective, or representative basis.

(vii) Survival

This Arbitration Agreement will survive any termination of your relationship with TikTok.

(viii) Severability

If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, then (i) the unenforceable or unlawful portion will be severed from this Arbitration Agreement, (ii) the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and effect, and (iii) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful portion will have no impact on the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining Claims on an individual basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, severance of any portion of the Class Action Waiver in Section 14.2(b)(vi) shall not be construed to permit you or TikTok to proceed with Claims in mass arbitration, to which the parties expressly do not consent.

(c) ONE YEAR LIMITATION PERIOD / LIMITATION ON LEGAL ACTION

YOU AND TIKTOK AGREE THAT YOU MUST INITIATE ANY PROCEEDING OR ACTION WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING RISE TO A DISPUTE THAT IS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE COMMERCIAL TERMS. OTHERWISE, YOU FOREVER WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION, OF ANY KIND OR CHARACTER, BASED ON SUCH EVENTS OR FACTS, AND SUCH CLAIM(S) OR CAUSE(S) OF ACTION ARE PERMANENTLY BARRED.";Disputes resolved individually through arbitration, not in court.;Commercial Terms

(a) Class Action Waiver 

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and TikTok acknowledge and agree that each is waiving the right to bring or participate in a class, collective, or consolidated proceeding against each other.

(b) Exceptions to Mediation and Arbitration

(c) Procedure

Subject to the exceptions in Section 14.3(b), if you have any claim or dispute against TikTok arising out of or in connection with these Commercial Terms, including any question regarding its existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity, the parties shall follow the procedure set out in this Section 14.3(c): 

(i) either party shall give to the other party written notice of the dispute, setting out its nature and full particulars, together with relevant supporting documents, and the parties shall agree to attempt, promptly and in good faith, to resolve such dispute by way of confidential discussions between the parties. The notice of dispute to TikTok must be sent to Kaleidoscope, 4 Lindsey Street, London, United Kingdom, EC1A 9HP, Attn: Legal Department and will be deemed to have been received upon delivery. For the avoidance of doubt, this notice provision applies notwithstanding the general notice provisions in Section 15.9.

(ii) If the dispute has not been settled within 30 days of the date the written notice issued pursuant to Section 14.3(c)(i) was deemed received, or within such other period as the parties may agree in writing, then the parties will refer the dispute to mediation under the International Chamber of Commerce (“**ICC**”) Mediation Rules or the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (“**CEDR**”) Model Mediation Procedure (as chosen by you). Unless otherwise agreed between the parties within 14 days of referral of the dispute, the mediator will be nominated by the ICC or CEDR (as applicable). 

(iii) If the dispute has not been settled within 60 days following the filing of a request for mediation or within such other period as the parties may agree in writing, such dispute will thereafter be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the ICC, which are incorporated by reference into this Section. 

(iv) Unless the parties agree otherwise, there will be one arbitrator (to be appointed by the ICC), the arbitration will take place in London, England, and the arbitration will be conducted in English.";Outlines arbitration process and class action waiver for UK, EEA, and Switzerland users.;Commercial Terms
